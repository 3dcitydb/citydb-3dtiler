!!! warning "This application is in the testing phase"

    This application is still in the testing phase. Please exercise caution when using it in production. Therefore, feedback is always welcome. Please feel free to create an issue on the GitHub page or contact me: murat.kendir(At)tum.de

**citydb-3dtiler** can generate 3DTiles (v 1.0 and 1.1) by reading features (aka. city objects) from 3DCityDB (v5.x), a database application that can import CityGML 2.0 or 3.0-based datasets. The application's key features are as follows:

- It can generate reports about the current data in the database or calculate the most efficient configuration parameters for creating 3D Tiles.
- It can assign colors or PBR materials based on object classes or the current property values of features.
- It can create separate 3DTiles based on object classes (other options planned).
- Tilesets can be customized with a simple CSV file listing materials.

## Special Thanks

This application is based on two important concepts and aims to bridge the gap between the concepts 3DTiles and CityGML.
To bridge this gap, two main elements have been used in this software:

1. 3DCityDB v5
2. pg2b3dm

***We would like to take this opportunity to thank Bert Temme, the developer of the pg2b3dm library, and all 3DCityDB developers.***
